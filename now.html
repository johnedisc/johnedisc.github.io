        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>I am currently working running jobsites in a small <a href="http://redfishllc.com/">remodeling firm</a> by day. 
            I come home to my beautiful fiancee, Miranda and baby boy, Arlo where we try our best to be silly and cherish that time.
             After bedtime, I am working through Head First HTML and U of Helsinki's Full Stack Open. I seek work as a 
             web developer to find a way to take care of my family that is both challenging and less taxing on my back.</p>
