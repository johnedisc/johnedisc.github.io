        <h1>100 Days of Code</h1>
	<h2>Day 8: 22 sept 2022</h2>
	<p>It is always harder than I think it will be for reasons that I do not expect. It is never that learn new material is too hard. And now that there is so little time to forge ahead, I never don't want to forge. No. The problem is not knowing which direction to walk. It can be paralyzing.</p>
	<p>I reminded myself today through a series of searches that I like vim. So here I am in vim. And I like linux and I like solving problems with a specific set of instructions. So I will continue learning. Javascript is sitting in front of me, so I will keep learning. I was just reading about destructuring arrays, and I am having trouble wrapping my brain around its uses. More on that to come. Most important is that we keep coming out everyday to learn. See you soon.</p>
	<h2>Day 6: 20 sept 2022</h2>
        <p>Today has included a lot of basic network knowledge. I was learning about TCP/IP 5 Layer model.
            I never knew how deeply complex it was to pass a packet across networks was. Thank you to the
            very smart people who got us to where we are.
        </p>
        <p>In CSS, finally looking at organizing blocks! So excited.</p>
        <h2>Day 5: 19 sept 2022</h2>
        <p>Trying to experiment with fonts in stylesheets. First, I tried a Google Font which I put in a link in the head of my html. Then I learned about a fontface and tried both the Google Font and a font from <a href='https://www.fontsquirrel.com/'>font squirrel</a>. So cool. It seems much less error prone. Only one link needs making to the stylesheet.</p>
        <h2>Day 4: 18 sept 2022</h2>
        <p>Today I have been learning about CSS inheritance, linking stylesheets and fonts, and pushing branches from my local directory to GitHub. So many cool things to learn!</p>
        <h2>Day 1: 15 sept 2022</h2>
        <p>This is the documentation of a serious change in my world on the heels of a lot of changes. We have a 6 month old boy called Arlo. He is with me now in my arms sleeping. meanwhile, this is written on an android.</p>
        <p>Many of us out there may do work which is not fulfilling and or not properly challenging or wherein we are not properly being taken care of. And for those who do not mind tinkering with computers in the nights after work and being continuously buried with new information you absolutely do not understand, computers can maybe provide that opportunity.</p>
        <p>The current goal is to become a web developer. First came <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>. it is an amazing resource and in the midst of starting there, I came across <a href="https://wickedlysmart.com/books/" title="use your head first"> head first</a> while looking through the very inspirational writings of <a href="https://sive.rs/" title="amaz8ng search features enclosed">Derek Sivers</a>. I have been working through Head First Html because it is providing more depth than freecodecamp.</p>
        <p>In discovering <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/" title="finland seems reallly cool and serious">Helsinki's full stack open</a> it has become clear that computer science fundamentals need a place in the studies. No more blowing past basic concepts that I kind of understand.</p>
        <p>So while practicing piecing together basic html and css here, the content that needs attention are things like TCP, bash, powershell, and SSH.</p>
        <p>Sure, it's some kind of transfer protocol. But what is it for? We often hear about it next to IP but what even is it? </p>
        <p>Already I have said too much. Until tomorrow.</p>
