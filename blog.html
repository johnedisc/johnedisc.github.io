        <h1>100 Days of Code</h1>
        <h2>Day 4: 18 sept 2022</h2>
        <p>Today I have been learning about CSS inheritance, linking stylesheets and fonts, and pushing branches from my local directory to GitHub. So many cool things to learn!</p>
        <h2>Day 1: 15 sept 2022</h2>
        <p>This is the documentation of a serious change in my world on the heels of a lot of changes. We have a 6 month old boy called Arlo. He is with me now in my arms sleeping. meanwhile, this is written on an android.</p>
        <p>Many of us out there may do work which is not fulfilling and or not properly challenging or wherein we are not properly being taken care of. And for those who do not mind tinkering with computers in the nights after work and being continuously buried with new information you absolutely do not understand, computers can maybe provide that opportunity.</p>
        <p>The current goal is to become a web developer. First came <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>. it is an amazing resource and in the midst of starting there, I came across <a href="https://wickedlysmart.com/books/" title="use your head first"> head first</a> while looking through the very inspirational writings of <a href="https://sive.rs/" title="amaz8ng search features enclosed">Derek Sivers</a>. I have been working through Head First Html because it is providing more depth than freecodecamp.</p>
        <p>In discovering <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/" title="finland seems reallly cool and serious">Helsinki's full stack open</a> it has become clear that computer science fundamentals need a place in the studies. No more blowing past basic concepts that I kind of understand.</p>
        <p>So while practicing piecing together basic html and css here, the content that needs attention are things like TCP, bash, powershell, and SSH.</p>
        <p>Sure, it's some kind of transfer protocol. But what is it for? We often hear about it next to IP but what even is it? </p>
        <p>Already I have said too much. Until tomorrow.</p>
