        <h1>100 Days of Code/Computers/Life</h1>
        <h2>1: 15 sept 2002</h2>
        <p>This is the documention of a serious change in my world on the heels of a lot of changes. We have a 6 month old boy called Arlo. He is with me now in my arms sleeping. meanwhile, this is written on an android.</p>
        <p>many of us put there may do work which is not fulfilling and or not properly challenging or wherein we are not properly being taken care of. and for those who do mot mind tinkering with computers in the nights after work and being cpntinuously buried with new information you absolutely dp npt understand, cpmputers can maybe peovode that ppportunity.</p>
        <p>the current goal is to become a web developer. first came <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a>. it is an amazing resource and in the midst of starting there, I came across <a href="https://wickedlysmart.com/books/" title="use your head first"> head first</a> while looking through the very inspiational writings of <a href="https://sive.rs/" title="amaz8ng search features enclosed">Derek Sivers</a>. I have been working through Head First Html because it is providing more depth than freecodecamp.</p>
        <p>In duscovering <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/" title="finland seems reallly cool and serious">helsinki's full stack open</a>it has become clear that computer science fundamentals need a place in the studies. no more blwowing past basic concepts that I kind of understand.</p>
        <p>so whilebpracticing peicing togrther basic html and css here, the content that needs attention are things like TCP.</p>
        <p>sure, its some kind lf tranfer prptpcol. but what is it for? we often hear about it next to IP but what even is it? </p>
        <p>already i habe said too much. until tomorrow.</p>
